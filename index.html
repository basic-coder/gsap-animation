        <h2 class="text1">A rich man's son was graduating college.</h2>
        <h2 class="text2">For months, the son was asking his father for a new car, knowing that his father had more than enough money.</h2>
        <h2 class="text3">When graduation day came, the young man's father called him into the study. The father handed him a wrapped gift and congratulated him about his graduation and his achievement.</h2>

    <div class="box2">
        <h2 class="text4">Looking disappointed, the son opened the gift to find a lovely, leather bound journal, with the young man's name embossed on the cover. He angrily raised his voice, threw down the journal and stormed out.</h2>
        <h2 class="text5">The young man had not seen his father since graduation day. He became successful and was wealthy like his father, with a beautiful home and family. He came to realize his father was aging and it may be time to put the past behind them.</h2>
        <h2 class="text6">Just then, he received a message that his father had passed, and he had to return home to take care of the estate.</h2>

    <div class="box3">
        <h2 class="text7">As the mourning son regretfully returned home, he began searching through his father's important papers and saw that still new journal, just as he had left it.</h2>
        <h2 class="text8">He opened it, and as he flipped through the pages a car key dropped from the back of the journal.</h2>
        <h2 class="text9">A dealer tag was attached to the key that read "Paid in full. Wherever this car takes you, write about it to remember it forever. Love, Dad"</h2>
